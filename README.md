Respiratory Rate Estimation Based on Detected Mask Area in Thermal Images


This repository shows the methods to calculate the respiratory rate and the results for all experiments performed in the work.


The paper will be presented during CVPMW on Computer Vision for Physiological Measurement.


All materials and results will be available after the presentation on CVPM23.
